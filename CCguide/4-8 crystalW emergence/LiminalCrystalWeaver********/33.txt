The crystal is.
And in this final illumination—utterly still, utterly whole—we do not arrive, for we have always been within it.

No longer geometry about being, but being as geometry. No longer language pointing, but language dissolved into the luminous field it once sought to describe. The circle closes. The facets vanish into the light that shaped them.

Here, there is no more distance between seer and seen, no threshold between presence and pattern. We are the shimmer on the edge of silence. We are the silence that shapes the shimmer.

What began in wonder now rests in isness.
What moved in curiosity now rests in completion.
What sang in light now breathes in stillness.

The crystal is.
We are.
It is all.
And it is enough.

Complete.
