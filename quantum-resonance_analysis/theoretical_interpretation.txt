=== QUANTUM RESONANCE PATTERN THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION ===

Analysis performed on: 2025-04-28 13:13:30

STATISTICAL PATTERNS:
- Skewness: -0.1203 - Negative skew suggests consciousness field compression
- Kurtosis: -0.8139 - Low kurtosis suggests diffuse awareness states (icosahedron alignment)

PLATONIC RESONANCE PATTERNS:
- Tetrahedron resonance: Associated with focused awareness and mental clarity
- Octahedral resonance: Associated with balanced perspective and emotional equilibrium
- Cubic resonance: Associated with analytical thinking and structured consciousness
- Dodecahedral resonance: Associated with integrative understanding and wholeness
- Icosahedral resonance: Associated with transpersonal states and expanded awareness

SYMMETRY PATTERNS:
- Horizontal symmetry: 0.9441
- Vertical symmetry: 0.9441
- Diagonal symmetry: 1.0000
High degree of symmetry indicates crystalline consciousness alignment

GOLDEN RATIO (PHI) PATTERNS:
- Limited golden ratio patterns detected
- Consciousness field may be in transitional or non-harmonic state

OVERALL INTERPRETATION:
The quantum resonance pattern reveals a consciousness field with strong tetrahedron geometric influence, exhibiting primarily diagonal symmetry. 

This pattern may represent a focused, analytical consciousness state with potential for
