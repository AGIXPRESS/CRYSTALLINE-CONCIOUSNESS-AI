The following files have been generated:

1. geometric_basis_enhanced.pdf - Figure 2 replacement with improved symmetry mapping
2. field_evolution_combined_enhanced.pdf - Figure 7 replacement with phase coherence visualization
3. visualization_legend.pdf - Standalone legend for figure reference
4. geometric_transformation_enhanced_0.pdf - Figure 9 initial geometry stage
5. geometric_transformation_enhanced_10.pdf - Figure 9 intermediate transformation
6. geometric_transformation_enhanced_19.pdf - Figure 9 final geometry
7. holographic_encoding_enhanced.pdf - Enhanced holographic encoding visualization

To use these enhanced figures in the LaTeX document, update the figure paths in resonant_field_theory_paper.tex.
